Timestamp	Standing	Do you feel like you are getting a satisfactory undergraduate CS education at ŞEHİR?	Would you recommend ŞEHİR CS to your friends?	What are the strengths of ŞEHİR CS?	What are the weaknesses of ŞEHİR CS?	If you were given the opportunity, what would you change regarding undergraduate CS education at ŞEHİR?
12/12/2016 11:07:03	Junior (Year 3)	Maybe	Maybe	Strength education, homeworks, assignments. They force to study very well	Teaching assistants not very effective extends some of these. 	I dont think about that.
12/12/2016 11:07:35	Junior (Year 3)	Yes	Yes	Rules 	Rules of the department	Curriculum , and some courses  
12/12/2016 11:10:29	Junior (Year 3)	Yes	Yes	Experienced lecturers, courses offered give the opportunity of becoming a versatile engineer after graduation, 	Low number of lecturers, combination of some CS courses with EE courses, 	I would make it more CS based rather than mixing some CS stuff with EE(except those that are must-know for CS students). 
12/12/2016 11:12:34	Junior (Year 3)	Maybe	No	Projects give experiences about  business life for future.	Assistants are not sufficient and they do not have experience about teaching the courses.	I want to teach the system and teaching  procedure with assistants. Assistants should have more experience. 
12/12/2016 11:12:34	Junior (Year 3)	Yes	Yes	A modern approach.	The departmental classes start in the 2nd year which is very late.	The programming must be in first year. I would decrease uni courses.
12/12/2016 11:14:55	Junior (Year 3)	No	Maybe	Very intense course planning	Does not teach programming well because we are starting to learn at second year	Definitely i wll decrease the number of common courses and we should have different exam for common course. For example, we have same exam with historians for the world civilization course and historians already studying that deparment.
12/12/2016 11:15:04	Junior (Year 3)	Maybe	No	Great contact with the academic staff when needed. 	APPLYING CURVE TO ALL THE COURSES: it weaknesses the level of classes and students don't study. Not a good programming course that teaches OOP. Third year students still don't know how to apply OOP logic in their projects. First and second year include courses that are not necessary for a computer engineer. Here I mean that the different Engineering departments should be specified early and not take the same courses till the third year. We don't learn anything related to the Computers in the first year. Teach more math.	Add a better programming course. Teach Python in the first year and the second year teach a different language like Java (because it is better way to teach OOP rather then Python). Open more courses as department electives. Give more real life projects, especially in the third year, not just small assignments that are given each two weeks. 
12/12/2016 11:16:22	Junior (Year 3)	Maybe	Maybe	 strong and good academically professors 	pushing students to practice topics without teaching them , and no many courses in other fields of CS, only few mandatory courses. 	giving less practice homework, and exams, as they are pushing the students, so teaching them the materials well, then giving one project at the end which cover the whole topics, and also providing more courses. 
12/12/2016 11:16:47	Junior (Year 3)	Maybe	Yes	Learning atmosphere, lots of researches to work on with professors, Classes are not crowded.	Not enough departmental courses in 4th year to choose from (what if I just don't want to study bioinformatics!), A LOT OF UNI ELECTIVE COURSES, we start our first programming course only in sophomore year! so we have very limited variety of programming languages in our courses (Java for example starts only in junior year!)	LESS UNI ELECTIVE COURSES, programming courses (at least introductory) in freshman year, Integrating programming in physics/calculus/Chemistry...etc slightly in freshman year, in order to get an idea why we are studying those subjects. I would also suggest an annual competition in order to encourage students to really apply what they learn.
12/12/2016 11:17:47	Junior (Year 3)	No	Yes	A modern approach to CS. Teaching Python, agile development etc and not teaching C++ just from the start and in depth. Taking example of the best universities from abroad and from Turkey. Also, I love project based course grading in our school. n other universities they always take midterm and finals on paper which is not very healthy. In third and fourth grade we have fridays wiyhout any course which leaves us time to develop ourselves and maybe work part-time.	We see so many non CS related courses that we start to learn CS in second grade and with little emphasis while in other colloges people of same age take a lot of CS related  courses that we seem to stay behind, and learn less thing. Also, we don't have much choice while choosing elective courses in CS.	I would put inrto to programming course to year 1.  Also, I would eleminate Chemistry, Biology and maybe Physics 1. Also, I may reduce the amount of general electives. I would make CS course midtrem and finals on computers. Such a non-cheating software can be develped for that and it would be much better than trying to debug code on paper. I would open more CS elective courses. If our advisors could help us arrange internship that would be great espacially abroad but I don't know if that would be viable.
12/12/2016 11:18:22	Junior (Year 3)	Yes	Yes	(close to) interactive education	homework-assignment and exam dates still need to evenly be distributed throughout the semester. (and, for some lessons, homeworks-assignments and lessons must have been connected to each other: NOT ONLY THEORY IN CLASS BUT ALSO HOW TO USE MATERİALS NEEDED IN HOMEWORKS AND ASSIGNMENTS, that's what should be given. (for example; "CS 240" in  "2015-2016 - Spring Semester" had that problem.)	I would reduce number of UNI lessons needed in CS program, because some UNI lessons are just a waste of time and grade for CS program, and sometimes students have more talent on equations and programming stuffs then on words; sometimes, representing an idea or a concept can be too hard with words and representing it with diagrams or with equations can be easier for some engineer student.
12/12/2016 11:18:43	Junior (Year 3)	Maybe	Yes	Working a lot in projects, and the outside class activities for CS .	Helping Student for understanding more the process of studding for specific course, and not encouraging them to do creative things.	I would make a more effective teacher-students relationship. the way courses are presented to students. like to visit working places, to check real companies what are they doing, so to be more close to what their job would be, how they will work. I would make other activities where students would start to do real things from what they learnt.  so students would not be just studding but starting to do their serious project, in that case even studding would be more effective, because you would be able to understand it more when you are doing the real projects. Doing competitions for those project as well. I would change the way of grading.
12/12/2016 11:19:34	Junior (Year 3)	Yes	Yes	Close connection with professors and high possibilities of projects in various fields with the help of the professors. Academic behaviour.	Systems not yet settled that give hard time to students such as assignment and projects and midterms and labs. Lack of proper and qualified teaching assistants.(it may not be related with the departmants decisions) Low student profile.  Feeling of floating in a storm on top of a piece of wood.(lack of reflective knowledge about the standpoint/abilities of the student at any given time)	I would try to teach the purposes and inclinations of the departmant from the first year.(like bioinformatics/genomics, big data, etc.) so that on a student that begins his/her education should be able to see where he is along the road in each and every course and lesson and let them see the consequences of their actions in a clear way such that it would show them how important their current actions are. I would distribute the heaviness of the courses so that there won't be some courses which give really hard times to students while some are just boring to them. I would try curing the lack of vision in the general spectrum of the CS students. 
12/12/2016 11:21:09	Junior (Year 3)	Maybe	No	Project and assignments are very beneficial for our future.	Assistants are not sufficient.	I want to change some assistants.
12/12/2016 11:21:17	Junior (Year 3)	Maybe	No	The instructors are very qualified in their branches. The language is English.	There should be more departmental courses rather than common UNI courses. Now we are in 3rd class, still we are having 3 dep courses, 2 common UNI courses.... Also there a lot of homework assignment project midterm loads. I cannot find time to start an Android project so forth.	More departmental courses but less burden. Likewise software lesson which is the ideal, there are 5 projects and 5 quizes which are not cumulative. If we are evaluated whether we are learning or not, check it through projects? Homeworks doesnt mean anything, we are making them from Internet. Also if there are projects, why mid terms? To sum up, take out the homeworks or other things that do not teach anything, get in either projects, or midterms. Please choose one. In one course we have 10 quizes, 5 projects 5 homeworks 2 midterms and 1 final. WHAT IS THAT? I am taking 7 courses. Please do not force us to be robotic people. No time for reading book, reading tefsir, hadith, no time for going theatre or cinema, no time for trekking... Less burden, more efficient I believe that... One more thing there are some students in the classroom who doesnt really care about the courses but asking questions that he/she doesnt care about the answer as well and making the whole class busy. I wish it could be possible to seperate the students more careful about the lesson (I dont want to say more successful). But I dont know how this is possible. Assistants should be selected better. They dont have fluent english, they are too young and inexperienced for this. Knowing well doesnt mean teaching well. Does it?
12/14/2016 8:40:45	Sophomore (Year 2)	No	No	Just the name of Sehir Uni. 	Unnecessary hard lessons. Bad instructors. 	Curriculum,instructors.
12/14/2016 8:56:10	Sophomore (Year 2)	No	No	Mr. Ali Cakmak	Studying coding to a paper ? 	Using computers instead ? 
12/14/2016 9:12:51	Freshmen (Year 1)	Yes	Yes	Teachers and education system	Students	I would change the exam system to people make study more 
12/14/2016 10:00:02	Sophomore (Year 2)	Maybe	Maybe	instructors	There are too many unnecessary classes (uni xxx, introduction to engineering)	I'd remove all unnecessary classes and leave which are about computer science or even engineering only
12/14/2016 10:28:29	Sophomore (Year 2)	No	Maybe	Courses about programming	Core Courses not related to CS	I would add interesting core, or optional courses in English about graphic design, game development, app development, and languages which are not going to be taught in sehir (I.e. C#).
12/14/2016 10:39:32	Senior (Year 4)	Maybe	Yes	Course contents are well planned.	There is not too much elective courses that written in curriculum.	CS is my life part so its not important  where I am studying. I am easy and self learner. I am happy with Sehir.
12/14/2016 10:55:33	Sophomore (Year 2)	No	No	It is a fonundation university.	It is not working systematically. Even it is a foundation University, we don t have  enough practise sections in some courses (Discrete Mathematics, System Design Fundamentals). In the first year of school, the courses are not valuable/helpful. Students should face programming course from the beginning of first year. 	I would open summer school for the programming course because for the student who start learning a computer language new, one semester is not enough to do practise and learn the whole topics. Also, instead of chemistry or biology courses, I would open mathematics courses (mainly algorithm) to prepare students' infrastructure before taking programming courses. Also I would open more courses such as System Design Fundemantels. In this area there are more interests. Students should be directed according to their interests such as medicine, mobile games, etc. They should focus more on their interest when they come to second year. Also the first year of school, students should be made being aware of their interests.
12/14/2016 17:41:24	Sophomore (Year 2)	No	No	Nothing	CS students has to focus on other classes rather than their own depeartment classes 	Curriculum
12/14/2016 19:22:42	Sophomore (Year 2)	Maybe	Maybe	i can say that ,we have a successful team of professors	that professors teaching is focusing on the exam and assignment, not to make sure of making us good in their courses	if i had that power, i will change some courses which is not beneficial and wasting the student time , i will add some courses like (courses about hardware & software) in the first year, in the second year i will give more time for learning python and make that course special for CS to focus more on staff and sapirate CS student from the others IE & EE, because the others don't needed as much as CS, Therefore, all their goal just to pass that course (we can make easy course just for them)
12/14/2016 19:23:17	Senior (Year 4)	Maybe	No	The only strength of Sehir University CS is good algorithms education.	Weaknesses of Sehir Cs are : does not let student to have free time  to develop himself , jumping from to basic to to advance in programming lectures . Not teaching today's world requirements such as mobile programming , game development , network and database.	I would definitely change (dicrease) number of assignments and exams. For me CS 361(SOFTWARE) is one of the well designed course. Because there is small quizzes it makes students to study continuously  and understand well. And also it gives students more chance to show abilities. In other courses we have Midterms which , students usually study before a day or two exam and has to study more materials.   
12/15/2016 9:22:27	Sophomore (Year 2)	Maybe	Maybe	being in istanbul	not enough application from what we study	have persistently robotics labs where software and hardware come together
12/15/2016 15:16:21	Senior (Year 4)	Maybe	Maybe	The atmosphere is kind of friendly, you can easily interact with your profs	The university is not ready to host engineering research, the labs are poor, some of the courses are completely irrelevant and are a waste of time	Betrer labs and more advanced courses
12/15/2016 15:16:36	Senior (Year 4)	Maybe	Maybe	The professors	Lack of teacher assistants	I would like more languages to be taught in school and also having specializations in computer science and opening more departmental elective courses
12/15/2016 15:24:59	Senior (Year 4)	Yes	Yes	We have respected professors who make sure we learn and support us both in and outside class 	I think a good portion of students are reaching their senior year with a very week background in programming 	I would move ENGR 211 to the first year instead of CS100 and introduce two programming courses (java and bash)
12/15/2016 15:28:25	Senior (Year 4)	No	Maybe	English as main language	One sided education around data mining and machine learning, core lessons of CS are taught on 4th grade as electives or missing, most of the electives are not available	Open lessons for Linux, Web programming, databases and change the programming practise into a simpler and more broad lecture
12/15/2016 17:05:45	Senior (Year 4)	Maybe	Maybe	profs	The lack of labs and advanced equipment  	I would like to let the hand-working practice and experiments to have more weight of the course than the reading or writing. 
12/15/2016 17:30:46	Senior (Year 4)	Maybe	No	Programming based 	Only based on programming and only one language is taught. Most of the elective courses in the syllabus have never been opened 	I would add courses about the other field like security, gaming, hardware courses, and one more programming language. Also core uni courses are just waste of time 
12/16/2016 1:54:15	Sophomore (Year 2)	Maybe	No	proffesors	course content	try to do more diffucult 
12/17/2016 2:04:45	Sophomore (Year 2)	No	Maybe	They have very good professors with good background.	They are NOT really specialized in CS. More likely in Human Science. And that is a bit of a proplem, cuz you can see a lot of interfering of unrelated courses into the curriculum of CS.	Decrease the amount of UNI courses and instead add more CS courses that can be beneficial in our career. Cuz if you compare a student in an unpopular instituion but specialized in CS with SEHIR CS student you would notice that the student from the unpopular institution knows more about CS then SEHIR student.
12/21/2016 14:03:55	Sophomore (Year 2)	Maybe	Yes	The teachers are really good at their area,and the quality of lessons are really satisfying.	We have too much theorical lessons and less practice lessons,especially in Freshman year.Additionally our practice lessons in year 1 and 2 are more about the EE department. Unfortunately, sometimes I feel like the other universities' students computer skills are better than me,as they have more practical lessons from the freshman year.	I would like to change the amount of practical lessons, more practical lessons, less theorical lessons, starting from the freshman.
12/22/2016 8:50:26	Senior (Year 4)	Maybe	Maybe	Nice curriculum (in terms of theoretical background)	Ignorance of some professors and faculty management	Create better resources and find better people to manage it
12/26/2016 9:10:14	Junior (Year 3)	Maybe	Maybe	It required hard study so it force student to study, research very much.	Teaching assistants is very weak actually, they are not very effective.	   '
12/26/2016 9:10:59	Senior (Year 4)	Maybe	Yes	You have a chance to work with professors.	There are limitations about variety of lectures.	I change the first year curriculum.
12/26/2016 9:17:55	Junior (Year 3)	No	No	All lessons have project and it provide to learn programming languages	There are too things which are 1 point	I raise the things of 1points , the most important thing is programming languages for cs student  and to focus that. 
12/26/2016 9:49:14	Junior (Year 3)	Maybe	No	Great academic members	Applying CURVE for almost every course. This just decreases the demand from the students to study more, and an A grade from this university does not always equal an A grade from other universities.	Don't apply curve. Study more math in the first year. Study Python in first year(because we literally study almost nothing related to engineering in the first year, except math and physics) and then Java on the second.
12/26/2016 10:49:56	Senior (Year 4)	No	No	Professors' knowledges	Lots of work in lots of classes.	Frame of managing mind. 
12/26/2016 11:10:00	Junior (Year 3)	No	Yes	-Student teaching assistants  -LMS and homeworks always done on computer -Usage of English language 	-Course material is not enough and easier than most top universities -Courses offered in the last year are not actually optional, Only couple courses can be selected out of all displayed courses on the website -Focusing on only one language (Python) and tendency to get rid of other programming languages in other courses like Java, C in the future. -Communication of TA's and Professors are done through email rather than an integrated system in LMS.	Courses should cover more material and grading should not be based on the overall student effort. For less work students can get a better grade letter compared to other universities. There should be more diversity in courses, even though there are different preferences every student has to take the same set of courses. More compiled languages like C/C++, Go etc. Especially Programming 1 and 2 is given too late, if possible programming 1 can be given in the first year instead of computer skills course. (which is redundant for the time being) TA and Prof communication can be done through a workflow software on LMS or SAP instead of chains of emails.
12/26/2016 11:13:17	Junior (Year 3)	No	Yes	our courses is carefully planned tested and applied(changes) we have some interesting subjects 	No sufficient practical tutorials , No variety of choices for CS(Gaming theory ,Robotics architecture )	1- Rearranging the course for first year , A first year engineer actually goes to the second year with no actual practical experience (especially after summer break which most of the students would remember nothing). Also, i would suggest that we add at least programming intro to it in the second semester.   2- in "computer Skills" why not include Photoshop basics which would really be useful , if computer skills is intended for Microsoft office,excel and Matlab then why not giving more 0 credits courses in the second year for 2 hours a week to give the chance for engineers to have more skills (could be Photoshop or 3d-desgining or mobile apps or any other subject that can improve students).  3- in general i feel we need more tutorials in some specific courses , more resources , lets take digital logic for example , we had no actual lab experience (except EECS201)but we had to make a project in lab(which was a mess tbh).  4- some courses in CS the letter grades should not be put according to avg ,if we wanted a really efficient engineers we should improve there understanding not lower grading scale.  5- more variety of courses (which we actually enjoy) , digital logic design was interesting.  but to be fair i do appreciate what the professors are trying to do, hopefully we can adapt to the best 
12/26/2016 11:26:16	Junior (Year 3)	Maybe	Maybe	Great teachers, nice classes.	Not particularly CS but general curricilum has too many out of department classes in my opinion. UNI classes are too many.	Reduce UNI classes add more CS
12/26/2016 11:37:37	Senior (Year 4)	Maybe	Maybe	some of the instructors  are good ones, 	not enough courses opened. not enough good professors,  most of the courses are not will organized and they follow an internet course! and they keep changing in the syllabus of the course each semester,   	REDUCE ThE CORE COURSES !! BRING BETTER (foreign) INSTRUCTORS. new bigger labs  
12/26/2016 18:14:27	Junior (Year 3)	Maybe	Maybe	New approach	Competition	More practice!
12/26/2016 23:15:45	Junior (Year 3)	Maybe	Maybe	Following the Computer Science field (any new development, what will happen in the future stuff like that) 	Practice sessions and assignments are not help to learn the course, hard assignments may discourage the student, some professors use the slides which is taken from the other universities or book and not efficient to learning. Students can reach the open courses  or watching from the youtube if they want. 	Making more efficient practices and assignments, not too much hard or not easy peasy, at least student who following the class and little study, can able to do these.  Professors prepare their own slides (some professors doing that ) its more helpful and not too much complicated, comparing with the other universities or book slides. As a student these are my opinion, our department professors making changes/decisions if they see any issue. ** I want to hope the IP addresses is not tracking :)
12/27/2016 0:41:16	Junior (Year 3)	Maybe	Maybe	academic staff	insufficient assistans	some assistans and some courses which are not related to engineering.
12/27/2016 16:40:58	Senior (Year 4)	Maybe	Maybe	Professors can give you personal feedback due to it being small	Needs to expand its course list	..
12/27/2016 16:51:49	Senior (Year 4)	Maybe	Maybe	Professors are available at any time.	University should be more selective while accepting students to university. Since student quality is very low, professors are not able to cover advanced topics.	Lectures are independent of each other however I think it is better to have a more holistic approach in class.
12/27/2016 16:53:13	Senior (Year 4)	Yes	No	Teachers	They are too young	Strict education plan
12/28/2016 0:08:56	Junior (Year 3)	Maybe	Maybe	english	few departmental courses	i would open some mobile programming courses. World earns tons of money from mobile apps and our university doesn't care about it. 
12/28/2016 11:00:25	Senior (Year 4)	Yes	Yes	Sehir has good teachers.	Sehir just gives assignments without teaching it. We need to learn properly in the lectures.After that, we could solve the problems.Problems should have some relations about the real life.	I would change programming courses types. These courses should encourage us to learn deeper.
12/28/2016 11:04:44	Senior (Year 4)	No	Yes	To apply what we learned. 	There is Just one computer language they gave and it is not using in the cs from company sides	I give at least two language for each year. And these languages should be usable in companies 
12/28/2016 13:10:34	Senior (Year 4)	Maybe	Maybe	The gained knowledge from abroad, like most of the professors are educated from U.S. 	The treatment of the students by the professors whether by assigned tasks pressure or dealing with students.	Offering many courses that a student would like to have. Also, providing facilities like laboratories for the students for more testing and advanced learning with applying science.  
12/28/2016 16:51:07		No	No	Provides good courses for data analysis	Not much variation of courses, no different research areas	Course contents to match other schools, provide different courses, research labs and funds, different reaearch areas.
12/29/2016 9:53:31	Senior (Year 4)	No	Yes	Data science	Cares of professor	Perspective of professor to student
12/30/2016 14:44:55	Senior (Year 4)	No	No	nothing	everything	shut cs education department down
